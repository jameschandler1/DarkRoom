technologies that were used to create this game include:
    -javascript
    -jquery
    -html
    -css
    -confirm.js

    1. the approach taken was first to wireframe ideas for layout
    2. next css, html and js files were set up and html bolierplate was created and additions were added for jquery and confirm.js
    3.html structure was created which includes a massive grid with over 300 individual boxes
    4. alerts were made using confirm.js this also includes actions attached to the buttons
        -hitting play starts timer and allows user to engage with the gameboard which was placed with the playAlert message
        -upon losing or dying the user is prompted with either one of two messages both of which allow the user to click a button to restart game.
    5. css was then implemented to include a flashlight effect, additional styling on nearly all aspects of the page to give the game a personal and terrifying feel.
    6. music was added and a button in the left hand corner below the title allows users to toggle sound (ps. i made the music myself so please try it out!
